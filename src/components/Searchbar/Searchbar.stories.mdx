two states. The initial state (`isSolid: false`) is used when the application
when searchbar needs to blend in into for example `Hero` sections. In that case,
The searchar will in a transparent design.

export const Template = (args) => <Searchbar {...args} />;

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story
    name="Default"
    args={{
      isSolid: false,
      searchDialogLabel: 'What are you looking for?',
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

In the second state (`isSolid: true`) the searchbar is embedded in a solid
container element. This is the case, when for example user is scrolling through
the application.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Solid"
    args={{
      isSolid: true,
      searchDialogLabel: 'What are you looking for?',
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Searchbar} />
